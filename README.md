# Project: Bayesian Optimization for Neural Network Architecture

## Overview

This project compares the performance of Bayesian Optimization and Grid Search for finding optimal neural network architecture hyperparameters.

## Project Details

**Objective:** Implement Bayesian Optimization and Grid Search to find the optimal neural network architecture for a classification task.

**Models Implemented:**
- ResNet18
- CNN-based network
